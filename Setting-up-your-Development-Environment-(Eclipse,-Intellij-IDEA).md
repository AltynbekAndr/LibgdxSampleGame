Libgdx projects are based on [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/), a build and dependency management system. It allows us to offer you the greatest flexibility when it comes to choosing your development environment. We support development on the command line as well as in Eclipse and Intellij IDEA (Netbeans may be an option in the near future).

For each of these environments you need to install a few things in order to be able to deploy to Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, Ouya, Blackberry, iOS and the Web. Follow the links below to learn what you need for your dev environment of choice.

### Setting up Eclipse


### Setting up Intellij IDEA

To develop your application via Intellij IDEA, you need to install the following pieces of software.

  * [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Intellij IDEA 13+](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), the Community Edition is sufficient
  * [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html), you only need the SDK itself, not the ADT bundle which includes Eclipse. Install all platforms via the SDK Manager!

To additionally target iOS

  * A Mac, iOS Development does not work on Windows/Linux thanks to Apple.
  * The latest XCode, which you can get from the Mac OS X App Store for free

Once all of these tools are installed, proceed to [Project Setup](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-setup%2C-running-%26-debugging)
