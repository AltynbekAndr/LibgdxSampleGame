If you use AdMob in your LibGdx apps, and have not updated recently, you should consider doing so soon!

Google says:
> Android (6.4.1 and earlier SDKs)
> Deprecated. On August 1, 2014, Google Play will stop accepting new or updated apps that use the old standalone Google Mobile Ads SDK v6.4.1 or lower. You must upgrade to the Google Play version of the Mobile Ads SDK by then.

The implementation is very close to the traditional "[[AdMob in Libgdx | AdMob in Libgdx]]" approach, so should be quite familiar :)
