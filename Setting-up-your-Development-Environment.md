Libgdx projects are based on [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/), a build and dependency management system. It allows us to offer you the greatest flexibility when it comes to choosing your development environment. We support development on the command line as well as in Eclipse and Intellij IDEA (Netbeans may be an option in the near future).

For each of these environments you need to install a few things. Follow the links below to learn what you need for your dev environment of choice.
