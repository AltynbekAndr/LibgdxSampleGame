[Excelsior JET](http://www.excelsiorjet.com/) enables you to distribute and deploy your Javaâ„¢ applications as optimized native executables that start and work faster, do not depend on the JRE, and are as difficult to reverse engineer as if they were written in C++. Excelsior JET currently allows you to create native executables for Windows and Linux and will soon also support Mac OS X.

This article runs you through the minimal amount of steps required to get your libGDX app compiled to a native executable with Excelsior JET!

1. [Package your libGDX application as an executable Jar for the desktop via Gradle](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-on-the-Commandline#packaging-for-the-desktop)
2. Install Excelsior JET. You can start with the trial. If you are happy, [buy a license](http://www.excelsiorjet.com/#pricing) (they also have discount programs)
3. Open Excelsior JET and create a new "Plain Java SE" project
4. Specify the output folder "Application's working directory", which should already contain your app's Jar file as generated by Gradle
5. Specify the command line `javaw -Xmx256m -jar yourapp.jar`. You can of course add or modify any VM parameters. Excelsior will invoke your app with the same parameters once packaged!

6. Click the `Next` button (right arrow, bottom right corner)
7. Perform a test run by hitting the `Run!`button and make sure your app works as intended. It may run a bit slower as Excelsior JET doesn't optimize anything at that point.

8. Click the `Next` button
9. Leave everything as is, click "Check consistency". You may get some unresolved import dependencies and some missing super classes. As long as these belong to libGDX or LWJL, you are fine!

10. Click the `Next` button
11. Leave everything as is, except for maybe the maximum heap size

12. Click the `Next` button
13. Set the executable name, leave the rest as is, click the `Next` button

15. Leave everything as is and hit `Build`. Save the configuration to your project's root folder. This will allow you to invoke the build from the command line, or load the settings into the Excelsior JET UI.

16. Wait for your app to be compiled/packaged to a native executable!
17. After compilation, try out your native executable and distribute it to your users!
