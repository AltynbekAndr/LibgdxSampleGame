To develop your application via Eclipse, you need to install the following pieces of software.

  * [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is usually sufficient.
  * [Android SDK and Eclipse ADT Plugin](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html), simply follow the installation instructions. If you work from source, make sure to install *all* platforms in the Android SDK manager!
  * [Eclipse Integration Gradle](https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle/), you only need to use this update URL: http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/gradle

To additionally target iOS

  * A Mac, iOS Development does not work on Windows/Linux thanks to Apple.
  * The latest XCode, which you can get from the Mac OS X App Store for free
  * [RoboVM](http://www.robovm.com/docs.html#eclipse), simply install the Eclipse plugin. Make sure to update the plugin frequently!

Once all of these tools are installed, proceed to [Project Setup](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-setup%2C-running-%26-debugging)
