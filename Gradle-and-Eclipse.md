### Importing to Eclipse
#### As a file system
#### Using the gradle plugin
If you are plugin orientated, you might want to import the generated project using the gradle plugin for eclipse.  If you have the plugin installed you can import the gradle project directly.

File > import > Gradle > Gradle Project
You then need to locate the root build.gradle directory and click "Build Model"

Leave everything as default and hit ok, it will start importing the project and downloading the stock dependencies \o/
