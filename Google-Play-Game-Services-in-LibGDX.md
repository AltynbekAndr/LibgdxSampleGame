[Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) offers cross platform social leaderboards, achievements, and much more (realtime multiplayer, cloud saves, anti-piracy...)

A [Super Jumper](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/demos/superjumper) based example that makes use of Leaderboards and Achievements is available to download from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theinvader360.tutorial.libgdx.gameservices).

The project is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheInvader360/libgdx-gameservices-tutorial), and a companion tutorial is available [here](http://theinvader360.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/google-play-game-services-tutorial-example.html).
