The Libgdx community is organizing [#libGDXJAM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/libGDXJam?src=hash), a game programming competition that will take place sometime in December, the final date is yet to be announced.

This article will take you through the rules and help you get ready to jam!

## Rules

**Note**: The following rules are not final, stay up to date on the [rules discussions](http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=20974).

### Theme
Submissions must meet the theme that the community will chose from. We are currently crowdsourcing a [list of ideas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wDLMLVjh4mpnoBIv6i2MxV4NCW6VOIhQ0-bghS869Q/edit). The best 5 themes from the list will be selected and the community will vote on the final theme one week before the jam starts.

### Assets
Use whatever you can find, be it something you created from scratch, or something from the interwebs. Make sure you are respecting the license though.

### Code
Use of libraries like gdx-ai, gdx-pay, Ashley or other 3rd party libs is absolutely allowed. Use of tools like Tiled, Overlap2D, etc. is absolutely allowed. Code you've written before is allowed.

What is NOT allowed is re-skinning an existing game!

### Prizes & Voting
[RoboVM](https://robovm.com/) and [Robotality](http://robotality.com/blog/) are sponsoring prices. The former will sponsor devices (Mac Mini, iPad and iPod Touch) whilst the latter will sponsor 20 Steam keys for [Halfway](http://halfwaygame.com/). Our partner [itch.io](http://itch.io/) is providing us with a super fancy game jam system that allows voting, which is a lot of work on their end already.

After the jam period of 4 weeks, we'll have 1 week of voting on itch.io. The winner of that community vote will get the Mac Mini. The iPad and iPod Touch will be awarded to the participants that 1) submitted an entry and 2) documented their development the most in a dev log and on Twitter, using tags that promote our sponsors (RoboVM, Robotality and itch.io). The dev logs will all be gathered in a single thread here on the forum. The tweets should be of the form *New screeny of my #libGDXJam game. Progress! @robotality @robovm*, or *New dev log entry for my #libGDXJam game @robovm @robotality*.

The Halfway keys will be awarded to 20 random submissions.
