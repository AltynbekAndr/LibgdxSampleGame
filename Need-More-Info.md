If you have been sent to this page it is because you failed to provide enough information for us to take action on your issue. We handle thousands of issues and cannot waste our time explaining how to properly post an issue. Instead we send you here, which explains what you need to do.

If your issue was also closed, don't take it personal or be offended. Instead, remedy the problem by posting the necessary information and we will re-open your issue. Do not file another separate issue for the same problem.

## What do I do now? ##

You need to post a proper issue. We have an extensive guide called [[Getting Help]]. Read it. Yes, the whole thing. 99% of the time you will need to post an [executable example](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-Help#executable-example-code).

## Why are you doing this to me? ##

A problem must be reproducible in order to 1) test and identify the problem, 2) implement a fix, and 3) verify the fix works. If we can't reproduce your problem, we can't fix it. We do not blindly implement fixes and hope they work. We close issues that don't provide enough information to make room for issues we can actually work on.

You may think you posted enough information for us to work on your issue. You are wrong. How do I know? Because we sent you to this page.

## Indignation, resentment, exasperation, and friends ##

libgdx is a community-based open source project. If you are not able to contribute a fix for your issue then we are happy to help, but we do require you to provide enough information so that our time spent on your issue is productive.
