To develop your application via Intellij IDEA, you need to install the following pieces of software.

  * [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Intellij IDEA 13+](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), the Community Edition is sufficient
  * [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html), you only need the SDK itself, not the ADT bundle which includes Eclipse. Install all platforms via the SDK Manager!

To additionally target iOS

  * A Mac, iOS Development does not work on Windows/Linux thanks to Apple.
  * The latest XCode, which you can get from the Mac OS X App Store for free

Once all of these tools are installed, proceed to [Project Setup](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-setup%2C-running-%26-debugging)
