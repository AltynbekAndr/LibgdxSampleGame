My game is too slow when running on PC with external Graphics Card and setup 2 monitors. On normal PC with onboard Graphics card it is ok.

Here's my application config:
appConfig = new LwjglApplicationConfiguration();
appConfig.stencil = 8;
appConfig.width = w;
appConfig.height = h;

Please explain me why?

Thanks.
