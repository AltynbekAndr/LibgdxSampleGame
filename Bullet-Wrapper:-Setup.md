To use bullet physics in your project, you’ll need to add gdx-bullet.jar to your main project. Alternatively you can add the gdx-bullet project to the projects of the build path of your main project.

For your desktop project you’ll need to add the gdx-bullet-natives.jar to the libraries.

For your android project you’ll need to copy the armeabi/libgdx-bullet.so and armeabi-v7a/libgdx-bullet.so files to the libs folder in your android project.

The Bullet wrapper doesn’t support GWT at the moment.
