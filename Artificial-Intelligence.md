The gdx-ai extension is intended to contain common techniques and algorithms involving Artificial Intelligence for games. The ai extension has no actual AI at this point and is currently under development.

The features currently supported are as follows:
* [[Message Handling]]
* [[State Machine]]

Hopefully new contributions and additions will come soon.
